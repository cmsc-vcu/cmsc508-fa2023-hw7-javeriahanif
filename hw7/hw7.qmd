## Overview and description

This database project involves creating my own database with tables like **people**, **skills**, **roles**, **peopleskills**, and **peopleroles**. The 'people', 'skills', and 'roles' tables have specific columns and data in rows. 'Peopleroles' and 'peopleskills' reference data from the 'people', 'skills', and 'roles' tables. The project also includes practicing with writing various SQL queries, such as SELECT, FROM, INSERT INTO, etc., and working with SQL data types.

## Crows-foot diagram

In this ER diagram, there is a 'Customer' entity with attributes such as id, first_name, and last_name. Another entity, 'Delivery-Address,' has an attribute called id. The 'Customer' entity has a one-to-many relationship with 'Order,' indicating that a Customer can place many Orders. Additionally, the 'Customer' entity has a one-to-one relationship with 'Delivery-Address,' suggesting that a Customer uses a single Delivery-Address.

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: false
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses
    CUSTOMER{
        int id
        string first_name
        string last_name
    }
    DELIVERY-ADDRESS {
        int id
    }
```

## Examples of data in the database

### People table

The *people* table contains elements that provide detailed information about a person, including specific details such as Discord handle and date joined. It includes columns such as id (PK), first name, last name, email address, LinkedIn URL, headshot URL, Discord handle, brief biography, and date joined.

Below is a list of data in the *people* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sql = f"""
select * from people;
"""
## Add code to list roles table here
try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

### Skills table

The *skills* table contains elements describing a skill, with columns including id (PK), name, description, tag, URL, and time commitment. The id, name, and description are straightforward. The skill tag groups skills based on categories. The skill URL includes information about certification, and the time commitment column indicates how much time must be spent to gain a certain skill.

Below is a list of data in the *skills* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sql = f"""
select * from skills;
"""
## Add code to list roles table here
try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

### Roles table

The *roles* table contains elements describing roles in a tech company, with columns including id (PK), name, and sort priority. The sort priority column is used to arrange roles in a specific order.

Below is a list of data in the *roles* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sql = f"""
select * from roles;
"""
## Add code to list roles table here
try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```


## Sample queries

Let's explore the database!

## Reflection


The assignment was not as hard as I expected. It started tough, but creating tables and inserting data became fun as I worked through each part. It allowed me to be creative and think through my actions instead of just writing code mindlessly. Although it was a bit tedious and confusing, once the database was done, the work got much easier. Writing queries was the most challenging part for me, and I need more practice. Creativity also took the most of my time, apart from writing queries. Queries were super confusing when we go deeper into getting data from multiple tables. I need more practice writing these kinds of queries.
